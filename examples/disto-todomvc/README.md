## Learning Flux

The [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) websites are great resources for getting started.

Read the blog post announcing Flux: ["An Application Architecture for React"](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html), then read more about the [Flux architecture](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) and a [TodoMVC tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/todo-list.html) explaining the structure of the files in this folder.  After you feel comfortable with the TodoMVC example, you may be interested in the [Chat App example](../flux-chat), which is more complex.

## Running Example

`npm install` Open index.html 

if you change any code run below in your CLI 

`browserify ./js/app.js -t [babelify --stage 0]  > js/bundle.js`
